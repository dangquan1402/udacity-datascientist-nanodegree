## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in exploring insights from a [Video Game Sales found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)  from vgchartz.com.

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies.
Fields include
- Rank - Ranking of overall sales
Name - The games name
- Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
- Year - Year of the game's release
- Genre - Genre of the game
- Publisher - Publisher of the game
- NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)
- EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)
- JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
- Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)- Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.

There are 16,598 records in this dataset. To better understand the game industry, in this post, I would like to answer the following questions:
- Which years have the most /least video game released?
- Which genre is the most common?
- Which region spends the most money on video games?
- See what happened over the years? Are they just popular for some years?
- What happened with sales via gene over time?
